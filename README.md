# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To determine how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This report takes a closer look at the Outcomes Based on Launch dates for the parent category of Theater, and the Outcome Based on Goals for the sub cateogory of Plays.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The following chart was created to visualize the the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each month over an eight year period from 2009 to 2017 for the category (Theater). The data set that this chart was built on can be found below the chart.

There are a few insights that can be gleamed from this chart.
1.) The number of successful campaigns is at its highest in May.
2.) The number of successful campaigns is at its lowest in December, and is equal to the amount of failed campaigns.
3.) The number of canceled campaigns is minimal compared to the grand total of campaigns run per month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The following chart was created to show the outcome of campaigns based on their funding goals for the subcategory "plays". The data set that this chart was built on can be found below the chart.

From the chart, campaigns are most successful in the $0-$10000 fundraising range. As the fundraising goal rises, so does the number of failed campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Looking at the dataset provided for the "Outcome Based on Goals" chart, it was difficult to determine whether or not the larger goals (>25000) should be included, as the number of total projects was far lower then total number of projects in the 0-10000 range. By bringing this point up later in the Additional Tables/Graphs, we can inform the reader of the small sample size of projects, and how it would skew the later half of the Outcomes based on Goals chart.

## Results

### Conclusion - Theater Outcomes by Date
Based on the analysis, one can conclude the following:
1.) May has the highest of successful theater campaigns. Therefore any future theater campaign plans, should focus more on the Month of May.
2.) December has the lowest number of successful theater campaigns, therefore it would be prudent to avoid fundraising in December.

### Conclusion - Outcomes based on Goals
Based on the analysis, one can conclude:
1.) Plays with fundraising goals under $5000 have the highest success rate, and therefore future fundraising goals for plays should fall within that range.

### Summary of Limitations
The current dataset and charts created do not allow us to see the success rate based on goals per month, or per country. This would help in determining trends on when and where the populace would be more open to spending more money.

The Theater Outcomes by Date chart is also fitered on the parent category "theater", which consists of musicals, plays and spaces. In order to retrieve more relevant data to Louise's ask, the chart should be filtered down further into "plays".

### Additional Tables/Graphs
Other possible tables that could be created would be a chart showing total successful fund raising campaign goals per month. Even though the month of May had the highest total number of successful campaigns, perhaps there may have been another month with a higher total.

Another table to look at, would be a variation of Outcomes Based on Goals. Instead of graphing the percentage of successful, and failed, one could use the number of succesful/failed. If these two graphs were used alongside each other, the reader would be able to visualize that there were far more successful campaigns in the 0-5000 range. For example, the user would have been able to see that the 100% failure rate in the band of 45000-49999 was based on only 1 campaign.
